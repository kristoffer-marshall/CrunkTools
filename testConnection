# USAGE: test_connection HOST PORT [CCEMAIL]
# DESCRIPTION:
#  This script will continuously attempt to open a TCP connection
#  to the specified host and port. When the connection succeeds,
#  an email will be sent out and the program will terminate. This
#  is especially useful in an environment where someone else is
#  doing your network change, or if you're testing something out
#  and don't want to waste time actively watching a server.
#
#  TODO:
#     * Allow one to specify TIMEOUT and SLEEP_TIME via argument
#     * Show usage
#     * Ability to inverse logic, so show when a port is closed
#     * Ability to keep the program running after email is sent
#		* Use raw sockets instead
